# Generative AI and LLM Projects

## Projects:

### 1. [Youtube-Video-Summarize-to-predict-if-safe-for-children](https://github.com/Shristy-stack/Youtube-Video-Summarize-to-predict-if-safe-for-children)
This Python script downloads audio from a YouTube video, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper, summarizes the transcript with BART, translates it using MarianMT, and analyzes its safety for children using a RoBERTa-based classifier.
### 2. [Document Comparison App (LangChain & Streamlit)](https://github.com/Shristy-stack/womenhackai2024)
This Streamlit-based application allows users to compare multiple PDF documents, analyzing semantic similarity and requirement fulfillment using OpenAI's GPT models, Sentence-BERT, and LangChain. It extracts, preprocesses, and chunks text from PDFs, then compares them using both embeddings and word-level matching. The results can be downloaded as a PDF report.
